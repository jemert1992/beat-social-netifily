# Netlify API Route Fix Guide

This guide explains the changes made to fix the API route issues with your Netlify deployment.

## What Was Fixed

The main issue with your Netlify deployment was that the API routes weren't being properly handled. This was causing 404 errors when trying to access endpoints like `/api/status`. The following changes were made to fix this:

1. **Updated netlify.toml Configuration**:
   - Added specific redirects for API routes
   - Configured proper handling for Next.js serverless functions

2. **Added Required Dependencies**:
   - Added `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` to package.json
   - This plugin is essential for proper Next.js API route handling on Netlify

3. **Updated Next.js Configuration**:
   - Added `target: 'serverless'` to next.config.js
   - This ensures Next.js builds in a way that's compatible with Netlify's serverless functions

## How to Deploy

1. **Upload the Fixed Package**:
   - Extract the zip file
   - Upload all files to your GitHub repository, maintaining the folder structure

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
   - The netlify.toml file will automatically configure the build settings

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - In your Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add your environment variables:
     - TIKTOK_API_KEY
     - SOCIAL_MEDIA_TOKEN

4. **Deploy and Test**:
   - After deployment, test the API endpoints:
     - `/api/status`
     - `/api/tiktok/account`
     - `/api/tiktok/post`

## Understanding the Changes

### netlify.toml

The key change is in the redirects section:

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/nextjs-api/:splat"
  status = 200
  
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/nextjs"
  status = 200
```

This ensures that API routes are properly directed to the Next.js API handler functions that Netlify creates during build.

### package.json

Added the Netlify Next.js plugin:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@netlify/plugin-nextjs": "^4.41.3"
}
```

### next.config.js

Added serverless target:

```js
target: 'serverless'
```

## Next Steps for Social Media Automation

Once the API routes are working correctly, we can proceed with implementing the full social media automation system as outlined in your original requirements:

1. User input for niche selection and posting frequency
2. Content analysis and trend identification
3. Content creation with various asset types
4. Caption and hashtag generation
5. Automated scheduling and posting
6. Performance tracking and reporting

The current fixes provide the foundation for building these features by ensuring the API infrastructure works correctly.
