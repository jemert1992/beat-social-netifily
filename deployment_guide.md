# Pure Netlify Functions Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the Social Media Automation API using pure Netlify Functions without any Next.js dependencies.

## What Was Fixed

The previous packages had issues with Next.js integration causing build failures. This updated package uses a completely Next.js-free approach with pure Netlify Functions:

1. **Removed All Next.js Dependencies**:
   - No Next.js plugins or dependencies
   - No webpack configuration for Next.js
   - No Next.js build process

2. **Simplified Configuration**:
   - Minimal package.json with only essential dependencies
   - Streamlined netlify.toml with direct function mappings
   - Pure HTML/CSS/JS frontend

## Directory Structure

```
pure_netlify_functions/
├── functions/             # Netlify Functions
│   ├── status.js
│   ├── tiktok-account.js
│   └── tiktok-post.js
├── public/                # Static frontend files
│   └── index.html
├── netlify.toml           # Netlify configuration
└── package.json           # Dependencies and scripts
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload to GitHub**:
   - Create a new repository or use an existing one
   - Upload all files from this package, maintaining the folder structure

2. **Connect to Netlify**:
   - Log in to Netlify (or create an account)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Use the default build settings (they're already configured in netlify.toml)
   - **Important**: Make sure to uncheck any Next.js related build plugins in the Netlify UI

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - After initial deployment, go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add your environment variables:
     - TIKTOK_API_KEY
     - SOCIAL_MEDIA_TOKEN

4. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Netlify will automatically deploy your site
   - Once deployed, test the API endpoints:
     - `/api/status`
     - `/api/tiktok/account`
     - `/api/tiktok/post`

## Understanding the Pure Functions Approach

### package.json

The package.json is minimal with no Next.js dependencies:

```json
{
  "name": "social-media-automation",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "netlify dev",
    "build": "echo 'No build step required for pure Netlify Functions'"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.27.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "netlify-cli": "^15.0.0"
  }
}
```

### netlify.toml

The netlify.toml file is simplified to only include essential settings:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"
  functions = "functions"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/status"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/status"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/tiktok/account"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/tiktok-account"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/tiktok/post"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/tiktok-post"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

## Local Development

To run the application locally:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables:
   ```
   TIKTOK_API_KEY=your_api_key
   SOCIAL_MEDIA_TOKEN=your_api_secret
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Visit http://localhost:8888 to view your application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Netlify deployment:

1. **Build Plugin Errors**:
   - Check if any Next.js plugins are enabled in your Netlify site settings
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Continuous Deployment > Build plugins
   - Disable any Next.js related plugins

2. **Function Execution Errors**:
   - Check the function logs in Netlify dashboard
   - Verify your environment variables are set correctly

3. **API Access Issues**:
   - Confirm your TikTok API credentials are valid
   - Check network requests in browser developer tools

## Next Steps for Social Media Automation

Once the API is working correctly, you can expand the system to include:

1. User input for niche selection and posting frequency
2. Content analysis and trend identification
3. Content creation with various asset types
4. Caption and hashtag generation
5. Automated scheduling and posting
6. Performance tracking and reporting
